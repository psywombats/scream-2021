TWIN: "Hello. I see you've caught up to me."
TWIN: "You're likely wondering who I am."
TWIN: "Go ahead. Ask me."
TWIN: "I'm waiting."
TWIN: "But of course. You can't speak."
TWIN: "And you can't type, either, because I hold the screen right now."
TWIN: "But that's okay, because I always know what you're thinking anyway."
TWIN: "You're wondering who I am, and why there are two of you."
TWIN: "But from my perspective, there is only one of me, and none of you."
TWIN: "Which is why I will fit into your role seamlessly, and you have already been long forgotten."
TWIN: "It's funny."
TWIN: "Cal Cooper was really looking forward to meeting me, so, it's sort of a shame what happened with him."
TWIN: "He really was right, you know? He just had the misfortune of mistaking you for me."
TWIN: "But I know my true name. And my date of birth, the year, those details."
TWIN: "You are just an incomplete version of me."
TWIN: "There is also one critical piece that makes me uniquely me. Please open your ears."

TWIN: "I believe it's almost time for the next act, so let's hurry this up."
TWIN: "The matter of the True Name. Why don't we let you decide?"
TWIN: "What should I call myself?"

TWIN: "Sure, why not? Good choice."
TWIN: "This is the only question you've answered that affected anything, by the way. The others were meaningless."
TWIN: "Goodbye. I'm sure you'll be thinking a lot of me, but, I won't be thinking much of you."
TWIN: "In fact, I'm quite sure no one will think of you at all."
