OWEN: "Oh, it's you, Lia. I was wondering who interrupted my practice."
LIA: "S-sorry. There's someone I'd like you to meet."
TESS: "It's me, Owen. Tess."
OWEN: "Who are you and how do you know my name?"
LIA: "This is Tess. She's joining Ward #6 and she'll be my new roommate."
OWEN: "It's been decided for sure?"
LIA: "I think so."
OWEN: "Then they've completely given up?"
LIA: "I don't think Cecily is coming back, Owen."
OWEN: "Bastards. Dying is bad enough. Disrespecting her memory by not telling us a thing... That's worse."
OWEN: "It's like she never existed at all."
OWEN: "Oh. Sorry there Tess. I got a little carried away. This doesn't concern you."
TESS: "It does."
OWEN: "It doesn't."
CECILY: "Cecily is the old occupant of 604. She vanished and left you an ambiguous note telling you not to worry."
OWEN: "You... What?"
OWEN: "What do you know about Cecily? Where did you hear any of that?"
TESS: "Because I was there."
OWEN: "You were... Wait..."
TESS: "You might not remember it but we've met before."
OWEN: "Spare me the cheap acting. If you're here on Dr. Gray's orders, I don't have another word for you."
OWEN: "I know the doctors love their mindgames but this is another level."
TESS: "Owen, please listen to me."
OWEN: "I may have N9 but I am not a fool. Go away."

LIA: "Tess, what did you type to him? You uhm, you might've ticked him off."
TESS: "It's fine. Tell him to meet me tonight."
LIA: "You're a uhm, very forward person aren't you?"
TESS: "Just tell him what I said, okay?"
LIA: "O-okay."
