TESS: "It's unfortunate."
CAL: "Yeah, I..."
CAL: "I'm so sorry."
TESS: "Sorry for what?"
CAL: "It's an expression of empathy."
TESS: "It's Joey that's torn up. Not me."
TESS: "Do you remember searching for Connie yesterday?"
CAL: "I wish I could give you the answer you wanted, Tess."
TESS: "I just want a yes or no."
CAL: "I'm sorry."
