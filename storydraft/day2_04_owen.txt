OWEN: "You seem out of sorts."
TESS: "I am."
TESS: "You honestly don't remember looking for Connie before?"
OWEN: "No. But obviously, you know I'm N9 positive. Forgetting random events is hardly unusual."
TESS: "This just happened yesterday."
OWEN: "If that were true, everyone else would remember as well. No way we all forgot something that recent."
TESS: "Then what do you think is happening?"
OWEN: "Deja vu."
TESS: "This is more than that."
OWEN: "It's possible that because of your N9 status, phenomena like false memories and deja vu could become more vivid..."
TESS: "Maybe you'll believe me if I remember where Connie was hiding."
