CAL: "Tess."
CAL: "Sheesh, don't look so shocked. It's just me. Or were you expecting someone else?"
TESS: "You caught me by surprise."
TESS: "I didn't mean to intrude, I just got lost going to the bathroom."
CAL: "Nice try, Tess, but I know you better than that."
TESS: "What're you doing here anyway?"
CAL: "This is my lab. I'm allowed to be here past midnight if I want."
CAL: "You aren't though. I can't have you running around here pulling power switches."
CAL: "I'm getting really really close, and that'd really set my progress back! Ahahaha."
TESS: "I'll go back to my room."
CAL: "Think you'll get off the hook so quickly?"
CAL: "Follow me."
CAL: "Oh come on. You know me. It's nothing sinister. Here, I'll explain on the way."
CAL: "Don't tell Dr. Gray, but I'm so extremely frustratingly close to getting to the root of Neural-9."
TESS: "A cure?"
CAL: "That's exactly it! Er, I mean, I'm not working on a cure, but a solution to the sort of thinking where we'd require a cure."
CAL: "We've been approaching the problem all wrong. Or at least I have. Who knows what Dr. Gray's been up to."
CAL: "But the point is, we've been taking an epidemiological approach, or sometimes a neurological one, but..."
CAL: "You can't cure Neural-9 because it's not a disease. It's more like... a property."
CAL: "It's an innate quality of being. Like being a natural artist, or a quick thinker, or a piano prodigy. You're born with it."
CAL: "Make sense?"
TESS: "None."
CAL: "This is a good a place as any."
CAL: "Maybe it's just my fortune that you showed up here tonight Tess. Or did you know I'd be here in advance?"
TESS: "I did not."
CAL: "All the same, I'm glad it's you."
CAL: "Hold still."
TESS: "Alright."
CAL: "Keep your gaze steady."
TESS: "Alright."
CAL: "Ready?"
CAL: "Now... Look directly into my eyes."
CAL: "Don't blink. Don't waver. I want to truly see!"
