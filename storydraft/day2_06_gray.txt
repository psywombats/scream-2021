GRAY: "I heard you found the rabbit."
TESS: "Yes, but, she's dead."
GRAY: "Then please hand over the corpse."
TESS: "It's in the storage room."
GRAY: "I suppose the rabbit's death was inevitable, but that doesn't make the cleanup any more enviable."
TESS: "She was fine last time..."
GRAY: "Eventually everything dies and is forgotten."
TESS: "Dr. Gray, do you remember us searching for Connie yesterday?"
GRAY: "..."
GRAY: "I'll dispose of the body. Please try not to upset the others."
