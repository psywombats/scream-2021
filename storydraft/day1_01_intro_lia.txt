TESS: "Hi. I'm Tess. Patient #2876."
LIA: "I-I'm Lia."
TESS: "Are you doing alright?"
LIA: "Just a bit nervous."
TESS: "That's alright. You're doing fine."
TESS: "Here's your half of the room there. I'll clear out my old roommate's things later, sorry about that."
LIA: "So you really can't talk?"
TESS: "I've forgotten how."
LIA: "Is... Is that because of NEURAL-9?"
TESS: "N9. Yeah."
TESS: "It affects everyone differently. If you're here, you must've tested positive too, right?"
LIA: "I've been positive half my life, but... I don't really get the details."
TESS: "It's not understood how it works."
TESS: "A new epidemic that degrades memory. Always fatal. No cure. Spreads with eye contact."
LIA: "I'm used to being blindfolded. Is it really alright?"
TESS: "Ward #6 is a dedicated N9 ward. All patients are positive, so we can uncover our eyes here, and the doctors wear protection."
TESS: "Maybe when the researchers here find a cure, we can go free in the outside world again."
TESS: "But until then, don't expect to be able to leave the ward."
LIA: "A-alright..."
TESS: "Do you have symptoms? Forgetting things?"
LIA: "No. Not yet, I guess."
TESS: "It happens to everyone slightly differently."
TESS: "But don't worry. Everyone here is about our age, and going through the same thing. We have to stick together."
LIA: "Y-yeah..."
TESS: "Here, follow me and I can introduce you to everyone."
