OWEN: "Oh. Tess. I was hoping I'd run into you. We need to - "
OWEN: "Who's this?"
TESS: "This is Lia. She'll be my new roommate."
LIA: "H-hello."
OWEN: "Owen. Great to meet you. I'm thrilled."
TESS: "Don't be mean."
OWEN: "If you've got a new roommate, that means they're giving up on Cecily."
TESS: "Not necessarily. She could still come back from... wherever she went."
OWEN: "But the doctors don't think it's nicely. And it's clear they're not telling us the whole truth about her."
TESS: "Sorry, Lia. Cecily was my old roommate."
LIA: "Then she um... She died?"
OWEN: "She was only 18. N9 shouldn't have been fatal to her for another few years."
OWEN: "She's alive out there somewhere. I know it."
OWEN: "...I should apologize, Lia. I forgot none of this concerns you."
LIA: "It's fine."
OWEN: "Well, welcome to Ward #6. I'm sincerely saddened that you had to come here, but none of us have any choice."
OWEN: "If you want some advice, keep your ears open, and don't take everything the doctors say at face value."
OWEN: "I think with Cecily gone, I've been here the longest now, so if you've got any questions, you know where to find me."
LIA: "Um, could I ask a question?"
OWEN: "If it's one I can answer."
LIA: "You play the piano?"
OWEN: "I won the Ettole Internationale at 14, and I was runner-up for the Brahms prize the year before that."
LIA: "I love music. Maybe some time I could listen - "
OWEN: "No."
OWEN: "If you two could leave now, I'm getting tired."
LIA: "S-sorry..."


TESS: "Don't worry about Owen. He can be a bit touchy but he's an okay guy."
LIA: "I hope I didn't make him mad?"
TESS: "He's a nerd for classical music, but don't bring up his playing. It's... not what it used to be."
LIA: "N9?"
TESS: "N9."
