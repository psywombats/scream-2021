CAL: "Cecily!"
TESS: "I am not Cecily."
CAL: "Hahaha! Maybe you're not. You don't look like her."
CAL: "But then who are you? That's what I thought I had figured out!"
TESS: "I'm Tess."
CAL: "That's not an identity! That's an experiment number!"
CAL: "Remember. I know, deep down, that you remember who you really are."
TESS: "I can't."
CAL: "You can. I know you can. You're the culmination of everything I've worked towards."
CAL: "Who are you? Who are you? I have proved myself worthy. Please tell me!"
TESS: "You're irrational, Dr. Cooper."
CAL: "Why do you insist on typing? Drop the charade. Speak. Speak!"
CAL: "Why do you just stand there? What do I have to do to prove myself to you?"
TESS: "Who do you think that I am?"
CAL: "I... You..."
CAL: "You are someone powerful and all-knowing. You knew my name. You knew the questions."
CAL: "You were the first to find the rabbit. It was..."
CAL: "You walk through life like you know every step of the way. You can know the future!"
TESS: "Because I've experience it before."
CAL: "Hahaha! Haha! That's it! You admit it! You have experienced events before they actually occur!"
TESS: "Becase they repeat."
CAL: "To one as all-knowing as your royalness, maybe. But to a mortal like me..."
CAL: "From the moment you walked into my lab today, I knew it was you. You called me by my name."
CAL: "I had forgotten I even had a name! But you knew. You even knew all my questions before I asked them!"
CAL: "You, who knows everything about me, and the path before me..."
CAL: "SPEAK! I COMMAND YOU TO SPEAK!"
CAL: "I demand my reward for awakening you! Tell me the great purpose for which I was placed into this world!"
TESS: "Dr. Cooper, I can't tell the future."
TESS: "It's more likely that you have forgotten the past."
CAL: "IMPOSSIBLE!"
CAL: "You blasphemer. You unholy, you abomination, you, you, you, you - "
TESS: "It was three nights ago that you exposed yourself to Neural-9, through my eyes."
TESS: "You are likely suffering from terminal N9."
CAL: "LIAR LIAR LIAR LIAR LIAR -"

CAL: "I hearby rid myself of my eyes. Now if you want to tell me lies, you must speak them."
CAL: "Well then, #2876? Cecily? Whoever you are? Have I proved myself?"
TESS: "Dr. Cooper, can you read me?"
CAL: "Well then? Well? Have I?"
CAL: "I can't hear your voice."
CAL: "Tell me... Just tell me..."
CAL: "Tell me it meant anything."
