TESS: "Hi Joey."
JOEY: "Oh, hi Tess. Did you come to play with Connie?"
TESS: "Actually I have someone I want you to meet. This is Lia. She's new."
JOEY: "Oh erm, hi."
TESS: "You should tell Lia your name."
JOEY: "It's Joey."
LIA: "Hi Joey. It's nice to meet you."
JOEY: "Do you want to meet Connie? She lives here too."
LIA: "Sure."
JOEY: "Connie, say hi."
CONNIE: "..."
JOEY: "She's not good with strangers."
LIA: "She's a... shy rabbit?"
JOEY: "Sure but she's friendly when she gets to know you. She's my best friend in the world."
JOEY: "You're number two Tess. Don't worry. Or maybe Nadine is. It switches. But it definitely isn't Owen."
JOEY: "Owen doesn't like Connie so he's not my friend either. Watch out for him."
LIA: "O-okay."
JOEY: "So what happened to your face?"
TESS: "Don't be rude, Joey."
LIA: "It's alright..."
LIA: "Everyone knows the disease spread through eye contact, so um, I was attacked when I was kid."
LIA: "They found out I had Neural-9 and um, tried to blind me with acid. So I couldn't spread it."
JOEY: "Did it work?"
LIA: "I can still see. But, that's when it was decided that I'd come to Ward #6, after that."
JOEY: "I'm new here too. If you're ever scared or sad, you can come find Connie. She'll be right here."
LIA: "Thanks."
