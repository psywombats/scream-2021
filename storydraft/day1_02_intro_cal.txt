CAL: "Hey Tess! Who's this fresh face?"
TESS: "Dr. Cooper, this is Lia. The new patient."
LIA: "N-nice to meet you Dr. Cooper."
CAL: "Just Cal is fine. And that goes for you too, Tess, for the thousandth time."
TESS: "I'll keep that in mind, Dr. Cooper."
CAL: "Sheesh..."
CAL: "Anyways Lia, I'm one of the doctors assigned to this ward. Well, more like a researcher than a doctor."
CAL: "But I'm sure we'll be getting to know each other soon!"
CAL: "I'm expecting some result in so I gotta run, but, see you at 4:00, right Tess?"
TESS: "Right."
CAL: "Seeya!"
