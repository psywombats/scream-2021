LIA: "Oh. You're back. Hi Tess."
TESS: "Hello."
LIA: "I wish I could've been more help looking for Connie..."
TESS: "You did fine."
LIA: "The atmosphere here feels so different from yesterday. No one really wants to see me."
TESS: "Everyone is processing, is all. We've had Connie for as long as I can remember."
TESS: "By the way, you did only show up here yesterday, correct?"
LIA: "T-that's right."
TESS: "Thank you. Sorry, sometimes with N9, it pays to double check."
LIA: "Are you going to be sneaking out again tonight?"
TESS: "I'm not sure."
LIA: "Oh."
TESS: "But if you could cover for me again I'd be grateful."
LIA: "I will. I'll do whatever I can."
TESS: "Goodnight."
