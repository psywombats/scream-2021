GRAY: "Ah. Lia. Patient #2902 and... #2867 was it?"
TESS: "It's Tess."
GRAY: "Right. I was just checking to make sure you were adjusting well."
GRAY: "Lia will show you around and introduce you to the other patients."
GRAY: "Please don't forget you have a checkup with Dr. Cooper at 4:00. Have a good day."
LIA: "Are you alright, Tess? You look pale."
TESS: "No."
LIA: "Do you want to rest a bit? Should I get Cal?"
TESS: "I am fine. Let's meet the others."
