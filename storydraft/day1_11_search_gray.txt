TESS: "Excuse me Dr. Gray."
GRAY: "Yes?"
TESS: "Do you know where Dr. Cooper is?"
GRAY: "I can relay a message."
TESS: "The ward pet got free. We're looking for it and thought he could help."
GRAY: "Dr. Cooper isn't paid to help you with things like that."
GRAY: "He may have low personal standards, but he's top-flight professional and at the top of this field and I won't have him interrupted."
TESS: "If there's a rabbit found in the rest of the hospital, could you let us know then?"
GRAY: "If I'm in the area."
GRAY: "Frankly a pet in a N9 ward is a terrible idea, around impressionable children..."
GRAY: "You can thank your Dr. Cooper's whimsy for that... Of course it was never going to end well..."
