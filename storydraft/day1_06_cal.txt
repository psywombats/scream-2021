CAL: "Hey! Tess!"
TESS: "Dr. Cooper."
CAL: "Did you lose track of time or what? I couldn't find you in your room, but you're late for your 4 o'clock!"
TESS: "I have to go, Lia. I'll see you back in the room?"
LIA: "Alright. Bye Tess, Dr. Cooper."
CAL: "It's Cal! I see Tess has been filling your head with weird ideas already. Sheesh."
TESS: "Let's just go."
CAL: "Your wish is my command."

CAL: "Alright. Are you comfortable?"
TESS: "I'm fine."
CAL: "You know the drill by now. I'm going to ask a series of questions to assess your cognitive state and powers of specific recall."
CAL: "Even if you feel like you don't know the answer, think carefully before you respond."
CAL: "Coming up with the right answer is less important than giving us a sample of your brainwaves to analyze. Ready?"
TESS: "As always."
CAL: "Could you please tell me your full name?"

choice("...Tess.", "I don't know.")
if choice_result == 0 then
    CAL: "Your full name."
else
    CAL: "Even just part of your name."
    TESS: "I can't remember."
end

TESS: "I am patient #2876. Two Eight Seven Six. T-E-S-S."
CAL: "..."
CAL: "You'll remember one of these days Tess. I know it."
CAL: "Next question... Could you please tell me the current year?"

choice("2021?", "I don't know.")
if choice_result == 0 then
    CAL: "I'm afraid it hasn't been 2021 for quite some time."
    TESS: "Then tell me what year it is."
else
    CAL: "Think harder."
    TESS: "I don't know. I don't remember. You never tell me."
end

CAL: "Moving on..."
CAL: "Can you tell me your place of birth?"

choice("Allsaints' Hospital", "I don't know.")
if choice_result == 0 then
    CAL: "No, that's the hospital you're in now. We don't even have a maternity ward."
else
    CAL: "That's alright. Plenty of kids don't know that."
end

CAL: "Okay! Drumroll please, this is the last question. Final Jeopardy!"
CAL: "Could you tell me please, what is my purpose in life?"
choice("To tease me with stupid questions, apparently.", "I don't know.")
if choice_result == 0 then
    CAL: "Sheesh, I can't catch a break today.")
else
    CAL: "Sheesh, you'd think you were born with that scowl on your face, Tess. Lighten up a bit."
end

CAL: "Thanks for bearing with me. We'll move on and take your vitals and do a basic checkup from here, although..."
CAL: "Next time please think a little harder about the questions, okay? It's really important for my research."
TESS: "Whatever you say."
