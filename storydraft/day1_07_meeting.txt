TESS: "What's going on?"
OWEN: "Joey's throwing a fit."
NADINE: "Hey, calm down, calm down. Blow your nose."
JOEY: "Someone must've left the hatch open! She could be anywhere!"
LIA: "Tess, it's the rabbit. I think she got loose."
OWEN: "That's the gist of it. Probably the thing made it to another floor, and it's not like we're allowed off this one."
JOEY: "What do we do?"
TESS: "We'll look for Connie in Ward #6. Dr. Cooper can check the other floors. If all look, I'm sure we can find her."
JOEY: "Okay. Thanks Tess. I don't know what I'd do without Connie."
NADINE: "I'll start here in the common room. Who's gonna talk to the docs?"
TESS: "I'll do it."
OWEN: "That's probably a good idea. Everyone else, start with your own room, and then we can cover the other spots."
LIA: "Tess, um... Can I come with you."
TESS: "I guess."
LIA: "I just don't want to get lost."
