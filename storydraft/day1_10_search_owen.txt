OWEN: "I don't suppose either of you have seen the rabbit yet."
TESS: "No."
OWEN: "Figures. It must've gotten downstairs. Hopefully no one kills it because it's been exposed to N9."
LIA: "Animals can carry it?"
OWEN: "No idea. It's not a well-understood disease, which is surprising given how devastating it could be if an outbreak became a full-fledged epidemic."
OWEN: "If someone told me my pet could be contaminated... Well, I wouldn't take any chances."
LIA: "That's horrible."
OWEN: "You haven't shown symptoms yet. The older you get, the worse it becomes. Have you seen what happens to infected adults?"
LIA: "No..."
OWEN: "You grew up really sheltered, didn't you?"
OWEN: "The point is, there's a reason we're all locked up in here. We're contagious."
TESS: "You can ease up a bit. She's been here less than a day."
OWEN: "Oh, right, Tess. I need to talk to you. I might have an idea about Cecily. But..."
OWEN: "Never mind. Meet me tonight at the usual spot and we can talk when there are less ears around."
