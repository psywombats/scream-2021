OWEN: "Tess. Are you alright?"
TESS: "I'll be fine. I'm more worried about Joey."
OWEN: "He's young. He'll forget eventually. I'm more worried about you."
TESS: "Me? What about me?"
OWEN: "You found Connie exactly where you predicted, didn't you?"
TESS: "I didn't predict it. It's where I found her yesterday."
OWEN: "Right. The deja-vu, or whatever it was."
TESS: "It really happened."
OWEN: "This is going to sound ridiculous, but..."
OWEN: "Are you familiar with the idea of a false memory?"
TESS: "It's not a false memory. It's exactly what happened yesterday."
TESS: "I found Connie there again. Doesn't that prove it?"
OWEN: "You're telling me you found Connie dead yesterday, she came back to life, then ran away, then died again in the same spot?"
TESS: "No. She was alive yesterday."
OWEN: "Oh. Then..."
OWEN: "I don't like this at all."
OWEN: "Of course it's a false memory. Not a random one."
OWEN: "Someone killed Connie, dumped her, then waited to see if you'd follow this false memory to the spot."
TESS: "They didn't need to hurt the rabbit. They could've just seen if I searched the same place, without kiling her."
OWEN: "No. No you're right, that doesn't make sense."
OWEN: "But it has to be a fake memory! Or a lucky hunch and a delusion. You're not delusional are you?"
TESS: "I think one of the signs of being delusional is you don't recognize that you're delusional."
OWEN: "Ha. Well, you're as level-headed as ever Tess, so, I guess you're not delusional."
OWEN: "Then what gives?"
TESS: "Everyone here is N9 positive. It seems unlikely, but maybe everyone else really did forget."
OWEN: "That would be a huge coincidence. Or else there's some specific pattern to the memories we lose..."
OWEN: "Or maybe -- how many days ago do you remember this taking place?"
TESS: "It was yesterday."
OWEN: "Maybe it happened months ago and you just forget that that much time has passed."
TESS: "It happened on Lia's first day here."
OWEN: "Hm... How many days has it been since she arrived now?"
TESS: "One. One day."
OWEN: "You sound convinced of that, but I can't say for sure. She's new, but..."
TESS: "It's been one day. Ask anyone. Ask her."
OWEN: "Listen, meet me tonight, right here. Bring the key."
TESS: "Alright?"
OWEN: "I have a really, really bad feeling. It's almost like..."
OWEN: "You ever miss a step on the stairs? It's like I missed a step and then looked down, and there's only a cliff, and..."
OWEN: "It's just crazy thoughts."
TESS: "What's worrying you?"
OWEN: "It'd make sense if... Like what if I never was any good at the piano."
OWEN: "It's just deja vu. I've played this before. I used to be good at this."
OWEN: "Maybe I didn't forget. I just have this stupid, sure feeling of something that never happened."
TESS: "That's a lot of what-ifs."
OWEN: "You're right. I'm overthinking it."
OWEN: "Let's go over things tonight. I want to see that lab you were talking about."
TESS: "It's a plan."
