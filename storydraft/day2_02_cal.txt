CAL: "Oh! Tess. It's just you. Phew."
TESS: "Don't I have a checkup this morning?"
CAL: "No, no, you definitely do. You just caught me while I was thinking is all."
TESS: "What exactly was it that you were doing last night?"
CAL: "Last night? Oh, haha, oh that, haha. Just a joke. You know me."
TESS: "You should test yourself for N9."
TESS: "You were exposed for almost a whole minute."
CAL: "I don't really know what you're getting at, Tess."
CAL: "I didn't get a whole lot of sleep last night, that's true, but I'm pretty dumb so if this is a practical joke, you'll have to explain it."
TESS: "Did you forget?"
CAL: "Tess, when you're an adult, you'll learn that there are certain things that are better left unremembered."
CAL: "Let's just get on with the checkup, shall we?"
TESS: "Yes Dr. Cooper."
CAL: "I'm going to ask a series of questions to assess your cognitive state and powers of specific recall."
CAL: "Even if you feel like you don't know the answer, think carefully before you respond. Are you ready?"
TESS: "As ever."
CAL: "Now, could you please tell me your full name?"

choice("Tess.", "I don't know.")
if choice_result == 0 then
    CAL: "Your true name."
    TESS: "That's all I remember."
    CAL: "Think harder."
    TESS: "Two eight seven six."
    CAL: "No, that's not a name. That's a stupid moniker that Dr. Gray gave you."
else
    CAL: "You're not even trying."
    TESS: "You already know that I don't remember."
    CAL: "You have to try."
end

CAL: "Now, what is your real, true name? Beyond Tess."
TESS: "I remember no other name but Tess."
CAL: "...Fine."
CAL: "Could you please tell me the current year?"

choice("2022?", "I don't know.")
if choice_result == 0 then
    CAL: "Wasn't that your answer yesterday?"
    TESS: "I don't remember."
else
    CAL: "I guess that makes sense..."
end
TESS: "If I ever get it right, would you tell me?"
CAL: "Could you please tell me your birth date?"

choice("March 4th", "I don't know.")
if choice_result == 0 then
    CAL: "That's... interesting."
    TESS: "Am I right? I don't know where that date came from."
    CAL: "Whether you're right or wrong doesn't really matter."
else
    CAL: "I understand you're mad at me, Tess."
    TESS: "I'm just confused."
    CAL: "Really. I think you're toying with me."
    TESS: "I assure you I am not."
end

CAL: "Okay, okay, enough of that. Let's go on to the final question. Are you ready?"
TESS: "I'm always ready."
CAL: "What do you call a tuna with a top hat?"

choice("Fishy?", "I don't know.")
if choice_result == 0 then
    CAL: "Nope!"
else
    CAL: "Oh come on Tess."
end

CAL: "Sofishticated! Get it?"
TESS: "I hope you weren't analyzing my brain waves for that one. They probably zeroed out."
CAL: "Haha, got you. Let's get the rest of this over with and then you can get back to your day."
