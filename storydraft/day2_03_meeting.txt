TESS: "Now what?"
OWEN: "Joey's throwing a fit."
NADINE: "Hey, calm down, calm down. Blow your nose."
TESS: "Don't tell me Connie got out again."
OWEN: "That's it exactly."
JOEY: "Someone must've left the hatch open! She could be anywhere!"
TESS: "You need to be more careful. How could she have gotten out again?"
NADINE: "Connie's been loose before?"
JOEY: "I'd never let Connie out of this room. When she's out of her hutch, she's always with me."
TESS: "This doesn't seem familiar to anyone else?"
OWEN: "No. Joey's a brat but he always takes care of the rabbit."
OWEN: "I hope she didn't make it to another floor... We'd have no way to get her back."
TESS: "Nadine. Are they pulling a prank?"
NADINE: "Huh? I don't think so, Tess."
JOEY: "What should we do?"
OWEN: "Maybe Tess can talk to Dr. Cooper and see about searching the other floors?"
TESS: "I have an idea where we might find her."
OWEN: "Okay?"
OWEN: "What's everyone standing around for? We should be searching."
JOEY: "Right! I'll start with my room.
JOEY: "...I don't know what I'd do without Connie."
NADINE: "I'll start here in the common room. Who's gonna talk to the docs?"
TESS: "I'll do it."
OWEN: "That's probably a good idea. Everyone else, start with your own room, and then we can cover the other spots."
LIA: "Tess, um... Can I come with you?"
TESS: "Stay here and look over the common room again. I have somewhere I need to check."
LIA: "Uhm... Alright."
