LIA: "Oh. You're finally awake."
TESS: "Sorry. It was rough last night."
LIA: "I didn't even hear you come in. I'm Lia, by the way."
TESS: "Yes?"
LIA: "Uhm, well, welcome to Ward #6. It looks like we'll be roommates, so, it's nice to meet you."
LIA: "Your name is Tess, right?"
TESS: "Yes."
LIA: "I'm sorry I haven't cleaned out all the stuff that's still here. It's all from my old roommate, but you'll have some space soon."
TESS: "These are mine. Don't touch them."
TESS: "I'm worried about you. You should probably see Dr. Cooper."
LIA: "You mean... Cal? I'm not sure what you mean."
LIA: "Let me know when you're ready and I can give you a tour of Ward #6."
LIA: "Allsaints is a pediatric hospital, so there's a bunch of people our age here. And everyone is N9 positive."
TESS: "Don't do this to me Lia."
LIA: "I-I don't mind at all. I have a lot of friends here. I'm supposed to introduce you."
TESS: "Lia, we've met before. Can you not remember?"
LIA: "How much do you know about Neural-9? It usually causes memory loss, so, if you're a little confused, it's okay."
TESS: "I am not confused."
TESS: "Please follow me."
LIA: "U-uhm, alright. Do you know where you're headed?"
