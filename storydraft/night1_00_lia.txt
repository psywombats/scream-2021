LIA: "Thanks for showing me around today."
TESS: "No problem. Thanks for helping us all look for Connie."
LIA: "It was fun! Seeing Joey so thrilled to have her back..."
TESS: "You'll fit right in here."
LIA: "I've... never really fit in anywhere."
LIA: "Since I found out I had caught N9, no one wanted anything to do with me. Even if I covered my eyes."
LIA: "I sort of wondered, you know, what if the acid really had blinded me? Could I go back to normal?"
TESS: "Even if we can't spread N9, we're still cursed with it."
LIA: "It was just a dumb dream."
LIA: "But everyone here seems so alive even if you've all got it way worse than me. It's almost nice here."
LIA: "Were you ever bullied before you came here?"
TESS: "I can't remember that far back."
LIA: "It gets t-that bad? When do your memories start?"
TESS: "I think I've been here a long time. No one else remembers when I showed up."
LIA: "Oh..."
LIA: "Maybe that explains why you seem to get along so easily with everyone."
LIA: "I wonder if someone like me could be like you."
TESS: "Actually, if I could ask you a question."
LIA: "...?"
TESS: "What year is it?"
LIA: "You don't remember THAT? I..."
TESS: "No. Tell me the answer."
LIA: "Uhm, I-I..."
TESS: "You too?"
LIA: "Maybe..."
TESS: "Hold on to your memories of the outside world. Even if they're bad ones.
TESS: "You might be the only patient in Ward #6 who still has them."
LIA: "I-I will."
TESS: "I promised I'd meet up with Owen tonight."
TESS: "Don't wait up for me, and if some nurse tries to check up on us, say I'm in the bathroom or somewhere."
TESS: "Goodnight."
