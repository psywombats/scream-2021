NADINE: "Hullo, ummm uhhh..."
NADINE: "Lia! Hi Lia."
LIA: "Hi Nadine. This is - "
NADINE: "Wait! Hang on, let me guess..."
NADINE: "..."
NADINE: "Nothing, sorry. I need to hit the cards, it looks like."
LIA: "This is Tess. She's new here."
NADINE: "Oh, alright. Bit of a quiet one, are you?"
LIA: "N9 has affected her speech pathways. Read what she's typing to you on the screen."
TESS: "Please remember me, Nadine."
NADINE: "Haha, I'll do my best, Tess. But sometimes that's just how it is."
NADINE: "I know! Hold still and I'll get my camera."
TESS: "That isn't necessary."
NADINE: "You've got such a cute face though! I wouldn't want to forget it."
TESS: "It was nice to meet you. Goodbye."
LIA: "U-uhm, isn't that a bit rude...?"
NADINE: "Ahh, it's okay. Joining Ward #6 is tough."
NADINE: "I'll see you around, Tess! I'm sure we'll be good friends in the future."
