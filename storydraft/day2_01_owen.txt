OWEN: "Any luck last night?"
TESS: "The stairs don't really go anywhere. They lead to the research lab attached to the ward, not the outside world."

OWEN: "No, never mind, stop typing. You're just copying verbatim what you've read off their pamphlets."
OWEN: "What if this wasn't a hospital, but just one ward? Ward #6 and a lab. Why else would you have a staircase like that?"
TESS: "Maybe they expect you to use the elevator."
OWEN: "Ugh. Never mind. But the point is, it's a dead end, and not a way out..."
TESS: "Not necessarily. I didn't get to finish exploring."
OWEN: "It's that big?"
TESS: "No."
TESS: "I got caught."
OWEN: "You what? Ugh, by all - "
NADINE: "Hey, what're you guys up to?"
OWEN: "Nothing."
NADINE: "You're such a bad liar. You're over here whispering to Tess about something, hmmm?"
OWEN: "Never mind."
TESS: "I've got my checkup with Dr. Cooper now anyway. Talk later."
